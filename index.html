            This is a simple webpage created using HTML. It contains links to different sections of the site, including Home, About, Contact, and Services. Each section has its own HTML file, and the links allow users to navigate between them easily. The webpage is structured with headings, paragraphs, and horizontal lines for better readability. The use of the <code>target="_blank"</code> attribute in the links ensures that each section opens in a new tab when clicked.<br><hr>
